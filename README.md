# Data_Projects_TripleTen

Projects I worked on while attending the Data Science TripleTen Bootcamp.


| Project number | Title | Description |
| :-----------: | ----------- |----------- |
| 1 | [Effect of IMDb Votes on TV Ratings](https://github.com/nelsonj1614/Data_Projects_TripleTen/tree/dc83fd428f0301cf98bc4586fd07be33de8a700e/01_TV_Ratings_Project)| The project task was to test the assumption that shows with high critic ratings also receive high IMDb votes. |
